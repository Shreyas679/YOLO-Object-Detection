# YOLO-Object-Detection
This Python-based real-time object detection application utilizes the YOLOv3 model, OpenCV, and Tkinter to provide a user-friendly graphical interface. It loads the YOLOv3 network with pre-trained weights and configuration files to detect objects in video frames captured from a webcam. The script leverages OpenCV’s dnn module for deep learning-based object detection and takes advantage of GPU acceleration if available to improve performance. It applies confidence filtering and non-max suppression (NMS) to refine detections, ensuring only high-confidence objects are displayed.

The application features an intuitive Tkinter GUI with a full-screen window where users can view real-time detection results. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labeled with class names from the COCO dataset. A status bar provides real-time updates, and a label displays the count of detected objects. Users can control the detection process with “Start” and “Stop” buttons, making it easy to enable or disable object detection. The script processes frames dynamically, continuously updating results when detection is active. Once stopped, it releases the camera resource and resets the interface.
